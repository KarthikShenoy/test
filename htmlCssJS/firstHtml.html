<h1> We are trying various elements of HTML</h1>
<p> This is the paragraph section of the element</p>
<ul name = ' unordered list'>
    <li> First item in the unordered list.</li>
    <li> Second item in the unordered list.</li>
    <li> Third item in the unordered list.</li>
    <li> Fourth item in the unordered list.</li>
</ul>
<section><i>Ordered List</i>, <em>sequential stared</em> at 200</section>
<ol Start = 200>
    <li> First item in the ordered list.</li>
    <li> Second item in the ordered list.</li>
    <li> Third item in the ordered list.</li>
    <li> Fourth item in the ordered list.</li>
</ol>
<section><i>Ordered List</i>, <em>reverse sequential</em> stared at 200</section>
<ol Start = 200 reversed>
    <li> First item in the ordered list.</li>
    <li> Second item in the ordered list.</li>
    <li> Third item in the ordered list.</li>
    <li> Fourth item in the ordered list.</li>
</ol>
<Section> <i>Ordered list </i>starting with <em>alphabets</em>.</Section>
<ol type = 'A'>
    <li>First element</li>
    <li>Second element</li>
    <li>Third element</li>
</ol>
<section><i> Ordred list</i> starting with <em>small letters</em></section>
<ol type = 'a'>
    <li> First element</li>
    <li> Second element</li>
    <li> Third element</li>
    </ol>
    <section> <i>Ordred list</i> starting with small letters but trying to <em>print reverse</em>   </section>
<ol type = 'a' reversed>
    <li> First element</li>
    <li> Second element</li>
    <li> Third element</li>
    </ol>
    <section>The <i>Italic</i> represented by the i and the <em>emphasis</em> represented by the em tag, do the same thing appearence wise, However there are symatic differences in the way they are interpreted.</section>
    <section>Along similar lines, we have <b>bold</b> represented by the b tag and the <strong>strong</strong> represented by the strong tag. These too look similar but have very different symantic interpretation.</section>
    <section> This section is added to show the mark tag which can hilight the selected text like we do on books <mark>hilight</mark></section>
    <section>This section shows the super script shown by the <strong>sup tag</strong>, 2<sup><mark>2</mark></sup> = 4. The other thing to note is the subscript with <strong>sub tag </strong>X<sub><mark>2</mark></sub></section>
    <section>These tags are needed only for concurrent document modification like in case of google docs or such. They are the insert and delete tags represented by ins and del keywords. The following text was inserted <mark><ins>hello</ins></mark> and this was deleted <mark> <del>hi</del> </mark> from the text. </section>
